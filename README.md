# ENPH253

##Cloning Instructions:
* Download git: https://git-scm.com/
* Navigate to where you want the project to be.
* Open Git GUI or use Git Bash to clone https://github.com/yjamie96/ENPH253-fluffy there.

##Making more files:
* Open project (sketch) in Arduino IDE.
* Drop down arrow on top right, select new tab.
* C Files - Make sure there is a header (.h) and c file for your functions.
* Arduino Files - do not specify a file type (ending), the code in this file will have access to all the code from the main file, and is automatically appended at compile time.

General plan for code: arduino .ino file is the one compiled with all other files, and the one that the arduino runs.
